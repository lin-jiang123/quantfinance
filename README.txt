The repository contains 3 py files (Q1/Q2/Q3) which answer the 3 questions respectively. The key outputs are saved in text files (Q1/Q2/Q3). 

All the data are fetched via my personal Quandl API. When running the scripts, please replace the API placeholder with a real Quandl API. 

Along with the py files, I've also enclosed a brief write up in the email.

Thanks!
